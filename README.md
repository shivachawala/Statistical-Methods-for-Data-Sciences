# Statistical-Methods-for-Data-Sciences
Successfully built several mini projects using R as a part of an academic course-[(CS 63113) Statistical methods for Data Science] using various Data Science techniques focusing on concepts such as:

• Probability, Simulation, Point Estimation, Transformation, Confidence Interval etc.

• Bootstrap Re-sampling: Estimated several sample statistics using this simulation based technique.

• Hypothesis Testing: Performed various alpha level tests on given data set by setting up hypotheses 
  and arriving at a conclusion. Also examined the duality between Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing.
